      <h3 class="w3-text-light-grey">Star birth and death</h3>
      <h2>Birth of Star</h2>
      <p>star begins to form as a dense cloud of gas in the arms of spiral galaxies. Individual hydrogen atoms fall with increasing speed and energy toward the center of the cloud under the force of the star's gravity. The increase in energy heats the gas. When this process has continued for some millions of years, the temperature reaches about 20 million degrees Fahrenheit. At this temperature, the hydrogen within the star ignites and burns in a continuing series of nuclear reactions. The onset of these reactions marks the birth of a star.</p>

    <h2>Death of Star</h2>
    <p>When a star begins to exhaust its hydrogen supply, its life nears an end. The first sign of a star's old age is a swelling and reddening of its outer regions. Such an aging, swollen star is called a red giant. The Sun, a middle-aged star, will probably swell to a red giant in 5 billion years, vaporizing Earth and any creatures that may be on its surface. When all its fuel has been exhausted, a star cannot generate sufficient pressure at its center to balance the crushing force of gravity.<br> The star collapses under the force of its own weight; if it is a small star, it collapses gently and remains collapsed. Such a collapsed star, at its life's end, is called a white dwarf. The Sun will probably end its life in this way. A different fate awaits a large star. Its final collapse generates a violent explosion, blowing the innards of the star out into space. There, the materials of the exploded star mix with the primeval hydrogen of the universe. </p>

    <h3>TYPES OF STARS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="protostars.html"><font size="5">Protostars</font></a></li>
            <p>A protostar is a very young star that is still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud. The protostellar phase is the earliest one in the process of stellar evolution.For a low mass star (i.e. that of the Sun or lower), it lasts about 500,000 years.The phase begins when a molecular cloud fragment first collapses under the force of self-gravity and an opaque, pressure supported core forms inside the collapsing fragment. It ends when the infalling gas is depleted, leaving a pre-main-sequence star, which contracts to later become a main-sequence star at the onset of hydrogen fusion.</p><div id="more" style="display:none;"><p>The energy generated from ordinary stars comes from the nuclear fusion occurring at their centers. Protostars also generate energy, but it comes from the radiation liberated at the shocks on its surface and on the surface of its surrounding disk. The radiation thus created must traverse the interstellar dust in the surrounding dense core. The dust absorbs all impinging photons and reradiates them at longer wavelengths.</p>

            <li><a href="dwarfs.html"><font size="5">Dwarfs</font></a></li>
            <p>A dwarf star is a star of relatively small size and low luminosity. Most main sequence stars are dwarf stars. The term was originally coined in 1906 when the Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung noticed that the reddest starsâ€”classified as K and M in the Harvard scheme could be divided into two distinct groups.</p><div id="more" style="display:none;">

            <li><a href="mains.html"><font size="5">Main stars</font></a></li>
            <p>Main sequence stars are characterised by the source of their energy. They are all undergoing fusion of hydrogen into helium within their cores. The rate at which they do this and the amount of fuel available depends upon the mass of the star. Mass is the key factor in determining the lifespan of a main sequence star, its size and its luminosity. Stars on the main sequence also appear to be unchanging for long periods of time. Any model of such stars must be able to account for their stability.</p><div id="more" style="display:none;">

            <li><a href="giants.html"><font size="5">Giants</font></a></li>
            <p>A giant star is a star with substantially larger radius and luminosity than a main-sequence (or dwarf) star of the same surface temperature.[Giant stars have radii up to a few hundred times the Sun and luminosities between 10 and a few thousand times that of the Sun. Stars still more luminous than giants are referred to as supergiants and hypergiants</p><div id="more" style="display:none;">

            <li><a href="neutron.html"><font size="5">Neutron Stars</font></a></li>
            <p>When stars four to eight times as massive as the sun explode in a violent supernova, their outer layers can blow off in an often-spectacular display, leaving behind a small, dense core that continues to collapse. Gravity presses the material in on itself so tightly that protons and electrons combine to make neutrons, yielding the name "neutron star.</p><div id="more" style="display:none;">

            <li><a href="binary.html"><font size="5">Variables,Doubles and Binary</font></a></li>
            <p>Binary stars and variable stars are two extremely important groups of celestial objects. Observations of binary stars have allowed astronomers to determine the masses of stars and provided a wealth of information on the density, atmosphere and evolution of stars. Variable stars too provide information about the interiors and evolution of stars. They are also extremely useful as distance indicators, allowing astronomers to measure the distance to the clusters and galaxies where they are found. Historically the study of binaries and variables has changed our understanding of the scale of the Universe.</p><div id="more" style="display:none;">

    <h2 font size="7">EMISSION AND ABSORPTION OF NEBULA</h2>
        <p>Nebula are clouds of high temp gases.The stars that are inside or near nebulae warm the temp. gas by UV(ultraviolet radiation),which cause the electron to ionize amd then emit the radiation in the form of radiowaves or light.Hydrogen is the one of the main element that emit red light.<br>Emission nebulae are sometimes known as H II Nebulae and are good indicators of newly born formed stars. The easiest to observe is the Orion Nebula .</p>
        <br>
        <p>Absorption nebulae are usually called dark nebulae for the very reason that they appear as a dark patch against the starry background of the Milky Way.<br>Absorption nebulae are usually called dark nebulae for the very reason that they appear as a dark patch against the starry background of the Milky Way.

They are gas and dust that block off the light from the stars behind them and are best seen set against the Milky Way or other nebulae.
A good example of this is the Coal Sack near the Southern Cross.

        <h2 font size="8">NOVA AND SUPERNOVA</h2>
        <p>There are two types of these items. Nova and Supernova. There are two types of Supernova also.</p>
        <h2 font size="5">NOVA</h2>
        <p>Nova is a dwarf with large mass takes material from a giant with low mass in a binary system. The surplus mass on the dwarf builds up and the material explodes. This process is often repeated.</p>
        <img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.SoXkyHdG7bw1-oAMA34YIQHaD-&pid=Api&P=0&w=297&h=160" style="width:29%">
        <h2 font size="5">SUPERNOVA</h2>
        <p>It is the explosion of a star in which the star may reach a maximum intrinsic luminosity one billion times that of the sun.<br>When a red giant's core with a mass greater than several solar masses and collapses in on itself at the end of its life. These are dramatic events as once they explode the core forms a neutron star or a black hole.</p>
        
         <img src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.a7zKXNuvCnhVm13Kzg38aAHaFj&pid=Api&P=0&w=226&h=170" style="width:29%">  
        
        <h2 font size="8">BLACK HOLES</h2>
        <p>A black hole is an extremely dense object in space from which no light can escape. While black holes are mysterious and exotic, they are also a key consequence of how gravity works: When a lot of mass gets compressed into a small enough space, the resulting object rips the very fabric of space and time, becoming what is called a singularity. A black hole's gravity is so powerful that it will be able to pull in nearby material and "eat" it.<br><br>No light of any kind, including X-rays, can escape from inside the event horizon of a black hole, the region beyond which there is no return. NASA's telescopes that study black holes are looking at the surrounding environments of the black holes, where there is material very close to the event horizon. Matter is heated to millions of degrees as it is pulled toward the black hole, so it glows in X-rays. The immense gravity of black holes also distorts space itself, so it is possible to see the influence of an invisible gravitational pull on stars and other objects.<br><br>A stellar-mass black hole, with a mass of tens of times the mass of the Sun, can likely form in seconds, after the collapse of a massive star. These relatively small black holes can also be made through the merger of two dense stellar remnants called neutron stars. A neutron star can also merge with a black hole to make a bigger black hole, or two black holes can collide. Mergers like these also make black holes quickly, and produce ripples in space-time called gravitational waves.</p>
